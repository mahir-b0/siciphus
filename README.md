# siciphus

This website allows users to encrypt text using the Caesar cipher. It's a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Usage

https://mahir-b0.github.io/siciphus/

1. **Input Text**: Enter the text you want to encrypt in the provided input box.
2. **Shift Value**: Enter the number of positions you want to shift the letters by in the cipher.
3. **Encode**: Click the "Encode" button to encrypt the input text using the Caesar cipher.

## Security

While the Caesar cipher provides a basic level of encryption, it's not secure for sensitive information. For stronger encryption, consider using modern cryptographic algorithms.
